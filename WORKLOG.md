Start of project, Day 1. Made empty class files for TetrisPlayer and TetrisGame and filled out simple get/set methods. 
Made drawBoard make a grid with colors for specific pieces. Need to finalize setup() and startGame(). 

### 5/23/23

Made a basic start screen, with a boolean to toggle the start of a game, completing phase 1. Started with making pieces with the
I piece, and sucessfully made it rotate using an origin and 3D array containing rotations. But rotating with the 3D array method poses potential issues with
shifting in cardinal directions. Need to experiment and work on shifting the piece in cardinal directions.

Beginning of project. Made empty class file for Piece and created get/set/constuctor methods. Began to work on tetrominos/shifting and rotating of them.

### 5/23/23

Continued to work on tetrominos and shifting/rotating. Created 2D arrays of tetrominos and created initial methods for rotating and shifting (may have to be reworked due to complexity of certain shapes of pieces).
