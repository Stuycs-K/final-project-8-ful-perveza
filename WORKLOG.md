### 5/23/23

Made a basic start screen, with a boolean to toggle the start of a game, completing phase 1. Started with making pieces with the
I piece, and sucessfully made it rotate using an origin and 3D array containing rotations. But rotating with the 3D array method poses potential issues with
shifting in cardinal directions. Need to experiment and work on shifting the piece in cardinal directions.
