## Overview
Our project is a remake of Tetris, complete with all tetrominos and scorekeeping.
This program is meant to be played like normal Tetris. Shift and rotate pieces in 
order to complete lines. Completing lines will cause the lines to dissappear, giving
you more room to place new pieces. Try to clear more lines at once to score more points.
As you progress and your score gets higher, your pieces will fall down faster as the levels 
get more difficult. A game over is reached when no new pieces can enter the screen.
